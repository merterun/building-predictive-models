This is a part of Cool R Things series made purely for educational purposes. Contains both .rmd file and the notebook.

In this series i demonstrate various things that R allows us to do from web scraping, building dashboards, creating maps and many more.

In this project, we leverage the ```caret``` package to execute ```k-fold cross-validation``` on a ```classification model```. By implementing this robust methodology, we gain insights into the model's performance and its ability to generalize to unseen data.
